# What is this repo for ?
This repository contains all the custom content i use for my mvm missions made for the moe community.
## How to install :
Go into the release page and download the custom content according to the mission.
Simply extract and drag all the folders into your tf directory, be cautious, your game has to be closed to reload your cache

Once you're done you can play my shitty missions and have fun lol.
